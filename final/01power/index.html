      <h2>Unlikely Powers</h2>
      <p>Cubic isn't your average superhero. His powers are one of a kind. He can fly, he has super strength, he can even erase your mistakes. Cubic is not a normal hero, he can turn into anythingâ€”found in an office supplies store. <br />
      A stapler, an eraser, a pair of scissors. The world is his oyster (or his Staples).</p>
