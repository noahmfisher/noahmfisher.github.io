      <p>How does something like this happen? It's an interesting story. Cubic was working in a staple factory, until one day he was attacked by a sentient stapler. It wasnâ€™t until the week after where he started to feel strange during his shift. His skin started to burn, and the only thing he could think about was Bic Brand White-Out. He rushed to the bathroom and began throwing it up. Moments later he was a lifesize bottle of it. From then on he knew his power, and has been trying to use it for good, even when evil haunts him.</p>
