      Cubic is a simple man, so many things could be considered his "weakness". Finding a bug in his house, running out of toilet paper, or even walking around in the kitchen with his socks on and stepping on a melted icecube. <br /><br />But there is one large offender: <strong>Robotics</strong>.<br /> Robots are taking over the everyman's office job. As robots are taking jobs, it's harder and harder to get ahold of everyday supplies.
