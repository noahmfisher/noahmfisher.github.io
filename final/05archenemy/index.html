      <p>Cubic for the most part is a likeable man, he makes friends fairly easy. But one group of people don't care for him much, his fellow <strong>superheroes</strong>.<br/> They don't like him much and don't take him seriously as a hero. Infact they regularly try to take him down during his crusades.
